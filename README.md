# kfan_homepage
This is my personal homepage! Here you can see what's inside here!
Actually I'm making this website directly using what I had learnt. And it was written using notepad++.
This is just a brief html file at this moment. But it will be finalized as I make progress in Web development. (Of course, Python is still my main)
